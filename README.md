# Generate Thickness Maps from 2D Projections

This repository provides a pipeline to generate thickness maps from 2D projection images. It is a side project of our research on single-energy image decomposition.

Our data pre-processing part relies heavily on **TotalSegmentator** for anatomical segmentation, which is built on the **nnU-Net** framework.
